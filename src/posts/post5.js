    title: "On Paper, Online, Onchain",
    content: `I have paper money, money online, and money onchain. I feel Monzo is fantastic - a FinTech bank, it's super cool for my day-to-day needs. Ethereum on the other hand, provides me a unique form of financial freedom that's very different from traditional banking systems. Having my money onchain, gives me full control over my assets. It's top-notch secure, transparent and free of censorship/fraud. The variety of ways I can manage my finances, think about it, it's exciting!`
