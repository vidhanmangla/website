    title: "The Underlying Philosophy of Value - Trust in a Government vs. Trust in a Decentralised Network",
    content: `Imagine we have a cryptocurrency that’s 100% collateralised by gold, and we operate a bank that’s open 24/7 to exchange our coin for gold stored in the vaults. People like the convenience of our coin, preferring it over lugging around physical gold. They treat our coin as if it were gold because they know they can exchange it for gold at the bank whenever they need to.

This setup is an example of our coin being exogenously collateralised by gold, pegged to its price, and governed by us since we control its issuance and burning. Since people can exchange their coins for gold at any time, the coin retains its value.

Now, let’s say the bank is only open five days a week. Does the coin lose its value just because people can’t always exchange it for gold? Probably not.

But what if the bank closes for a week? Does the coin lose its value then? And what if we close the bank for a month, a year, or a decade… or even forever? If we reach a point where no one can actually exchange their coins for gold anymore, perhaps people would still use the coin as a currency, even though it’s now backed by nothing.

At this stage, the coin would have shifted from being exogenously backed to now being endogenously backed—supported purely by itself. The coin initially being backed by gold could eventually become a form of fiat currency if people continue to use it based on trust alone, even without the ability to redeem it for gold.

Fiat currencies are centralised, backed by governments and actively managed by central banks, with their value driven by trust in the government, foreign exchange markets and market demand. In contrast, Bitcoin and Ether are decentralised, backed by technology and network consensus, with their value driven by scarcity, utility, and market demand.

So, how are Bitcoin and Ether fundamentally any different from the Dollar or the British Pound Sterling, other than their differences in governance, issuance, and the nature of their value?`
